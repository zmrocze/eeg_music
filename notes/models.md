## waveform

1. Just UNet on 0.1-1s chunks.

2. UNet diffusion on 0.1-1s chunks.

3. same ^ but guided on a chunk of spectrogram from spectral

## Spectral

4. EEGpt finetuned to produce spectrograms:

 - diffusion or in one go?
 - easier to train. but if works could see if abstract latent space can be trained with jointly with a vocoder for improvement.


Q1: Where to start: 1 or 4?
